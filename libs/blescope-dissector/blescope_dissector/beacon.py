    -----
    - measured_power_dbm is the calibrated RSSI at 1 meter (a signed value, typically around -59 dBm).
    - tx_power is kept as a backward-compatible alias for measured_power_dbm because older code
      sometimes misused the name. If only one is provided, values are mirrored during __post_init__.
    - This "measured power" is NOT the BLE AD Type 0x0A Tx Power Level (which can be positive and
      represents transmitter output power in dBm). Do not use AD 0x0A value for distance estimates.
